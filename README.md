# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

## Introduction
Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges leading up to Christmas. This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## 2023

In 2023, I'm using the [aocd](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) Python plugin to simplify data fetching and submission. Make sure to place your AoC token in `~/.config/aocd/token`.

### Running Solutions
- Run solution for day n with `py ./day_n.py`.
- Options:
  1. `a`: Submit part a (star 1).
  2. `b`: Submit part b (star 2).
  3. `e`: Use example input from `example.txt` in same directory.

Example: `py day_3.py -- a b`

## Rust Practice (Bachelor's Thesis)
During my bachelor's thesis, we used Rust to create a [quantum computer simulator](https://github.com/DATX11-22/quaru), and since Ive never used Rust before, AoC felt like a good place to start. The directory 2022_Rust contains my Rust implementations of a few AoC problems.

## 2022
This year, I'm using Python and focusing on efficient problem-solving. Thanks to [Ryerzs](https://github.com/Ryerzs) for the template for each day!

## 2021
Most solutions are written in C# scripts and can be run with [dotnet-scripts](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) like this:
```
> dotnet script <filnamn>.csx
```
