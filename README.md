# AOC

## Look at my "great" solutions if u like :)

2023 i will try using the [aocd](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) python plugin, so that i dont have to manually copy and paste the input or the output.
Since aocd will both fetch the data and sublitt it for me! :)

Make sure to have your aoc token in `~/.config/aocd/token`, if you dont know how to find it you can [look here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code/issues/1) for some help! 

Run solution for day n with `py .\day_n.py `
If run by arguments no answers will be submitted, posible options are:

1. `a` : submit part a (star 1)
2. `b` : submit paty b (star 2)
3. `e` : use example input from `example.txt`

Example of how to submit both parts for day 3:
`py day_3.py -- a b`
